# Requirements

In order to run the samples contained in this repository one needs to have a single Redis instance running.  Redis distribution could be obtained from [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download) or [https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis) (for Windows).

# Standing Up a Redis Server

Once Redis is unpacked, launch it with the default settings:

    redis-server

You should see a screen similar to this:
